    "# General Problem Solving Techniques\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook is a collection of general problem solving techniques that can be used to solve a wide variety of problems. The techniques are not specific to any particular domain or problem type, but are general enough to be applied to a wide range of problems. The techniques are presented in a step-by-step manner, with examples to illustrate how they can be used in practice."

    "## 1. Understand the Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "The first step in solving any problem is to understand the problem itself. This involves reading the problem statement carefully, identifying the key components of the problem, and understanding what is being asked. It is important to make sure that you have a clear understanding of the problem before you start working on a solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "If this was interview question, you should ask clarifying questions to make sure you understand the problem."

    "## 2. Break down the problem\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you have a clear understanding of the problem, the next step is to break it down into smaller, more manageable parts. This can help you to identify the key steps that need to be taken to solve the problem, and can make the problem easier to solve.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example let's take a problem of getting out of bed in the morning. You can break it down into the following steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Open your eyes\n",
    "2. Sit up\n",
    "3. Swing your legs over the side of the bed\n",
    "4. Stand up\n",
    "\n",
    "Of course it is possible to fail at any of these steps, but breaking down the problem into smaller parts can make it easier to solve.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Identify the inputs and outputs\n",
    "\n",
    "You need to clearly identify what the inputs to the problem are, and what the expected output should be. This can help you to understand what information you need to work with, and what you need to produce as a result.\n",
    "\n",
    "This involves clarifiying the constraints and the data types of the inputs and outputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example if you are inputing numbers, what kind of number? Integers, floats, etc. is it 8bit, 16bit, 32bit, etc. - signed or unsigned?\n",
    "\n",
    "Same goes for strings, what kind of strings are you inputing? ASCII, Unicode. If Unicode, what kind of encoding? UTF-8, UTF-16, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "Also for inputs, how many inputs are you expecting? Are they fixed or variable?\n",
    "If we have a list/sequence of inputs, what is the maximum length of the list? What is the minimum length of the list?\n",
    "\n",
    "The length of the list can be important because it can help you to understand the complexity of the problem. If the list is very long, you may need to use a more efficient algorithm to solve the problem. For 10 inputs even factorial time complexity can be acceptable, but for 1000 inputs it will surely not be. Similarly quadratic time complexity can be acceptable for 100 inputs, but not for 1 000 000 inputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now same goes for outputs, what kind of output are you expecting? What kind of data type? What kind of constraints?\n",
    "\n",
    "### Identify the subproblems\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you have identified the inputs and outputs, you can start to break the problem down into smaller subproblems. This can help you to identify the key steps that need to be taken to solve the problem, and can make the problem easier to solve.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if you are trying to find the maximum value in a list of numbers, you can break the problem down into the following steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Read the list of numbers\n",
    "2. Initialize a variable to store the maximum value\n",
    "3. Iterate over the list of numbers\n",
    "4. Update the maximum value if the current number is greater than the current maximum\n",
    "5. Return the maximum value\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: essentialy you've already solved the problem by breaking it down into smaller subproblems. and you can now solve each subproblem individually.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: iteration over the list of numbers might be trivial in most high level languages, but in some languages like assembly it can be a bit more complex.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note2: another way our solution can be slower than expected is if we use some slow feature of the language. For example if we use a slow string concatenation in Python, it can make our solution slower than expected. So it is important to know the language you are using and the complexity of the operations you are using.\n",
    "\n",
    "Also there is a saying by Richard Feynman on solving problems:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Write Down Problem\n",
    "2. Think Real Hard\n",
    "3. Write Down Solution\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: Richard Feynman was a famous physicist and a Nobel laureate. As for computer science, Feynman worked on Thinking Machines Corporation, a company that was trying to build a supercomputer. So he was also involved in computer science. Src: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Feynman\n",
    "\n",
    "Src: https://www.benkuhn.net/thinkrealhard/\n",
    "\n",
    "Of course, this is a simplification, but it's a good starting point. The more tools we have under belt the better we can solve problems by thinking real hard - ie seeing analogies between problems, using known algorithms, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here we can think of writing down the problem as understanding the problem, thinking real hard as breaking down the problem and writing down the solution as solving the subproblems.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is also an analogy with rubber duck debugging. Src: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubber_duck_debugging\n",
    "\n",
    "With rubber debugging you explain the problem to a rubber duck, and in the process of explaining the problem you often find the solution. This is because you are forced to break down the problem into smaller parts and explain it in a way that is understandable to someone else.\n",
    "\n",
    "Rubber duck debuggin also forces you to restate your assumptions and to make sure that you have a clear understanding of the problem.\n"

    "## 3. Develop a plan\n",
    "\n",
    "Look for patterns in the problem, and try to identify a general approach that can be used to solve it. This can help you to develop a plan for solving the problem, and can make it easier to implement the solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is where your knowledge of algorithms and data structures comes in handy. You can use this knowledge to identify the best approach to solving the problem, and to develop a plan for implementing the solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example you could start with some sort of brute force solution and then optimize it later.\n",
    "\n",
    "Maybe you can use a known algorithm to solve the problem, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "Maybe you can come up with a greedy solution and see if that leads to a solution.\n",
    "With greedy solutions we might find one of the following:\n",
    "1. The greedy solution is the optimal solution\n",
    "2. The greedy solution is not the optimal solution, but it is close to the optimal solution\n",
    "3. The greedy solution is not the optimal solution, but it is a good approximation of the optimal solution\n",
    "4. The greedy solutions actually is not possible to solve the problem and one needs to use a different approach\n",
    "\n",
    "Then you can see maybe I can store/cache some subproblems to avoid recomputing them, etc. - essentially trading memory for time.\n",
    "This memory for time could potentially involve dynamic programming, memoization, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "Maybe you can subdivide some problem into smaller problems and solve them individually and then combine the results to get the final result. - essentially divide and conquer.\n",
    "\n",
    "Maybe you know some graph algorithms that can be used to solve the problem, etc. For example maybe you could use some shortest path algorithm such as Dijkstra to solve the problem, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "Often times see if sorting the input can help you solve the problem, etc.\n",
    "It is possible there are multiple ways to solve the problem, and you can try different approaches to see which one works best.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another thing to remember:\n",
    "- If you can't solve the problem, solve a simpler version of the problem. - we can call this relaxation of some constraints."

    "Once you have a plan, you can start to optimize it. This involves looking for ways to make the plan more efficient, and to reduce the time and space complexity of the solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "It would inolve looking for bottlenecks in the solution and trying to optimize them.\n",
    "\n",
    "Also it would be a good idea to at least roughly analyze the time and space complexity of the solution.\n",

    "Also this could involve parallelizing the code, etc. - ie using multiple cores to solve the problem.\n",
